 	    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
 	    <p>- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</p>
 	    <p>- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web Pages</p>
 	    <p>- HTML describes the structure of a Web page</p>
 	    <p>- HTML consists of a series of elements</p>
 	    <p>- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</p>
 	    <p></p>
 	    <p>- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "What is HTML" as Heading, and "HTML stands for..." as Paragraph,</p>

 	    <h2>Example Explained</h2>
 	    <p>The combination of & with lt or gt gives the possibility to post code output in html</p>
 	    <p>The "<" and the ">" like that you can display even non displayable codesnippets like Doctype</p>
 	    <p>The &lt!Doctype html&gt is the declaration that defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>
 	    <p>The &lthtml&gt element is the root element of an HTML page</p>
 	    <p>The &lthead&gt element contains meta information about the HTML page</p>
 	    <p>The &lttitle&gt element specifies the title of the HTML Page (it is shown in the Tabname)</p>
 	    <p>The &ltbody&gt element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible content, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
 	    <p>The &lth1&gt element defines a large heading</p>
 	    <p>The &ltbr&gt element has no end tag, it is an empty element and can be used for spacing</p>
 	    <br>
 	    <p>The &ltp&gt element defines a paragraph</p>

        <h2>The different Elements</h2>
 	    <h3>The &lt!Doctype&gt declaration</h3>
 	    <p>The Doctype declaration represents the document type and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.</p>
 	    <p>It must only appear once, at the top of the page (before any html tags!)!</p>
 	    <p>It is not case sensitive!</p>
 	    <p>&lt!Doctype html&gt is the standard declaration for HTML5 !</p>
